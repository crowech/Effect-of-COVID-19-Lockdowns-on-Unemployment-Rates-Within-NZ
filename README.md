# Group Paper about the effects of Covid 19 lockdowns on unemployment rates within NZ

The investigation aims to investigate if Covid 19 lockdowns affected the unemployment rate in New 
Zealand. To do this I have used two different prediction methods, I used these predictions to create a 
forecast starting from March 2020. Creating forecasts from March 2020 shows us what might have 
occurred if New Zealand did not go into any lockdowns. It is important to remember that there is some 
uncertainty around the forecasts for events that are out of our control. To create these forecasts, I have 
used the forecast algorithm Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and the Drift method. 
AIRMA is an algorithm that bases its prediction on its past time series data that are not affected by the
time of year. The Drift method creates a forecast based on the average change over time. This means 
the average past unemployment rate directly affects the future.
